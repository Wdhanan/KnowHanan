		<h3>Full Stack Developer!</h3>
		<p>Hello, Hanan Wandji is my name. I'm 23 years old and i'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Applied Science Kaiserslautern. 
			I've got a lot of job experiences, for example, as a Working Student in Software Development at Pit Cup GmbH, where I developed and wrote automated tests for web applications. 
			During my internship at Mercedes Benz Bank, I worked on the implementation of an interface to facilitate the upload of data to a GRC-Tool.
			I also gained valuable experience as a Working Student and Bachelor Student at Camline GmbH. As a Working Student, I developed an automated interface 
			for uploading Jira issues from a CSV file to Jira, utilizing Python, FAST-API, Excel, Pandas, and JIRA REST-API. Additionally, I set up a pipeline with 
			GitLab and Jenkins for version control. During my Bachelor project, I developed a Python application for consistency checking of a complex operational 
			dataset in the manufacturing execution system environment. This involved requirement analysis, creating a specification document, software implementation, 
			acceptance testing, user testing, and setting up a Jenkins and GitLab pipeline.
			I'm a huge fan of new technologies, artificial intelligence, and data analysis, and I never miss an opportunity to extend my knowledge. I can master a 
			lot of programming languages and frameworks like Java, Python (FAST-API), C/C++, Spring Boot, Microprofile, Jenkins, JIRA REST-API, R, AngularJS, HTML, JavaScript, 
			TypeScript, Git, GitHub, GitLab, and many more.
			As a programmer, I like to push my limits every day. I believe in continuous growth and keep abreast of the latest advances in the industry. Taking on new challenges 
			is an essential part of my career path, and I'm constantly looking for innovative solutions to improve my skills and contribute to the field.
			Thank you for taking the time to get to know me better. I look forward to the exciting opportunities that lie ahead as I continue to explore the vast
			 world of computing and technology. There is much more to know about me, but I would not be able to write it all in just a few lines.
			
			Hanan ☺️
